Final Project
1. I would like to create a code that can recommend music based on an input. The input will be the mood you're feeling and what you hope to feel after listening to music or watching a show/movie. Do you need to feel comforted or motivated? This code will also hopefully be able to recommend artists based on the emotions provided by the user.
2.a. In total, the user will get asked 3 questions. This function will ask a few questions to the user beginning with "How are you currently feeling?"
2.b. It will then ask "What do you hope to feel?"
2.c. Another two questions will be asked: "Do you want to watch or listen to something?" Based on already categorized shows and music, the user will be provided with recommendations on what to watch/listen to.
