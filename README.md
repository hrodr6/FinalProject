Final Project


1. My Final Project will be a cognitive science experiment. It will be a false memory test. The participants will be given a set of words from a list. They will be shown the list twice; each word presented for an amount of time. Then, they will be asked to respond if the word was present in the list or not. It will count how many were correct and how many were false. They will get a percentage and an explanation on what false memories are and why it occurs anatomically.

There will be four main functions. 
2.a. memory_test(word list) The function will present  words based off a provided list twice. 
2.b. present_or_not() It will then generate words that were either present in the list or are synonyms. The participant will have to respond with a yes or no. The time of each response will also be recorded. 
2.c. analyze_response() The next function will check to see whether or not the responses were correct. 
3.d. give_results() This function will give the percentage result of the test. It will also provide the explanation of false memories and why they may have potentially gotten a bad score. 

I will be working alone on this assignment.
