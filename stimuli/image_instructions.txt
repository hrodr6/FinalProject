Hi Participant! Have you ever found yourself remembering something that didn't actually? Do you trust your memory? Let's test it. In this experiment, you will be shown a list of words that are related to a theme. Each word will be individually presented for an short amount of time. Try to remember the words shown. In this memory test, you will see another sequence of words. If you believe you saw the word in the original list shown, then  answer "yes" by pressing the "u" key. If you did NOT see the word in the original list, indicate the answer "no" by presenting the "i" key. When you are ready to begin seeing the list, please press the SPACE BAR. 
Now you will take the memory test. You will see a sequence of words. As a reminder, if you saw the word in the previous list, press the "u" key. If you did NOT see the word in the previous list, press the "i" key. Please rest your right hand on the keyboard on the "u" and "i" keys. Please try to respond as quickly (you will be timed) and as accurately as you can.

GO!
You have completed the experiment. Thank you for your participation! This has been the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm which studies false memories. You were presented with "lure" words that were not actually present in the list. Did you think they were present in the list? Because of the lure word's strong association with the list that is closely related semantically, you were more inclined to believe it was present in the familiarization list. Memories are able to change upon retrieval when reactivated. Memories are not concrete. They are not a video recording of what happened and can be edited over time. Do you still trust your memory? Please press the SPACE BAR to quit and view how many you got incorrect.
